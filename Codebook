-DATA-
=====================================================================================================================
Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset
Jorge L. Reyes-Ortiz, Davide Anguita, Alessandro Ghio, Luca Oneto.
Smartlab - Non Linear Complex Systems Laboratory

Experiments were carried out on a group of 30 volunteers between the ages 19-48 by. Each person performed 6 activities 
while wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using the phones embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, 
3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz.
70% of the volunteers were selected for generating training data and 30% for test data. 

-Test group data-
X_test.txt: Includes observations for each subject-activity on 561 time and frequency domain variables. 
Y_test.txt: Each row identifies the activity performed using a class label.
subject_test.txt: Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. 1-30.

-Training group data-
X_train.txt:Includes observations for each subject-activity on 561 time and frequency domain variables.
Y_train.txt: Each row identifies the activity performed using a class label.
subject_train.txt: Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. 1-30.

-Supplementary-
features.txt: A 561 vector with time and frequency domain variable names.
activity_labels.txt: Links the class labels in the Y files with their activity name

-Variables-
======================================================================================================================
SubjectID = identification number for each subject 
  Integer type, ranges from 1-30
Activity = activities completed by each subject as part of the experiment
  Character type, activities include: Laying, Sitting, Standing, Walking, Walking_Downstairs, Walking_Upstairs

*Notes on the following variables: the value for each variable is the average for each Subject-Activity combination on that measurment.
Some of the variables include X,Y,Z referring to either the X, Y, or Z axis. All are numeric type.*

-Cleaning up the data-
======================================================================================================================
After reading the data files in, they were merged together by first combining columns of the test and train datasets 
separately and then combining the rows of the two groups.
A new data frame was created that only included the SubjectIDs, Activities, and means and standard deviations of each
experimental measurement. 
Column names were added to the measurements.
Data were then grouped by Subject Id and Activity and each column was averaged to make one row per SubjectID-Activity pair.
